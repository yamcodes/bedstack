title: Bedstack RealWorld
description: A full-featured, production-ready app built with Bedstack, following the RealWorld spec.
---

[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) is "the mother of all demo apps" - a spec to build a clone of Medium.com using any combination of frontend and backend technologies. Bedstack implements this spec.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) version 1.0.6 or higher.
- Terminal for accessing Bun via its command-line interface (CLI).
- Text Editor with TypeScript support.
  - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is recommended for the best experience; other IDEs have been reported to cause issues with ElysiaJS's type inference system.

### Setup

1. **Clone and install dependencies**

   ```sh
   gh repo clone yamcodes/bedstack
   cd bedstack
   bun i
   ```

2. **Ensure Docker daemon is running and spin up the Postgres+Bun container**

   ```sh
   bun db
   ```

3. **Migrate the schema to the database**

   ```sh
   bun db:migrate
   ```

4. **Run the app**

   ```sh
   bun dev
   ```
