title: Development & Testing
description: How to maintain and test the Conduit implementation.
---

Developing on the Conduit app is designed to be fast. This guide covers the essential workflows for building and verifying the application.

## Development Workflow

1.  **Watch Mode**: Run `bun run --cwd apps/conduit dev` to start the app with auto-reloading.
2.  **Linting & Formatting**: We use **Biome**. Run `bun run fix` from the root to automatically fix issues.
3.  **Database Changes**: If you modify a `*.schema.ts` file:
    - Run `bun run --cwd apps/conduit db:generate` to create a migration.
    - Run `bun run --cwd apps/conduit db:push` to apply it.

## Testing Strategy

Bedstack uses Bun's built-in test runner. There are two types of tests in this codebase:

### 1. Unit Tests
Located next to the source files (e.g., `users.service.test.ts`). These focus on testing business logic in isolation.

```bash terminal
# Run all unit tests
bun run --cwd apps/conduit test:unit
```

### 2. API Compliance Tests
These are the rigorous [RealWorld API tests](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld/tree/main/api). They ensure the app is 100% compliant with the specification.

To run these:
1.  Make sure the app is running in dev mode.
2.  Run the following command:

```bash terminal
bun run --cwd apps/conduit test:api
```

## Exploring with Swagger

Thanks to Elysia's integration, you can explore the entire API without writing a single line of client code. Open `http://localhost:3000/swagger` to:

- View all endpoints and their expected request bodies.
- Execute real requests against your local database.
- See real-time validation errors if your request is malformed.

## Deployment

To build a production bundle of the Conduit app:

```bash terminal
bun run --cwd apps/conduit build
```

The resulting binary will be optimized and ready for deployment in any cloud environment.
