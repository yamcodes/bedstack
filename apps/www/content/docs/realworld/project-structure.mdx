title: Project Structure
description: Exploring the structure of the Conduit implementation.
---

The Conduit application is located in `apps/conduit` and serves as a blueprint for the [Bedstack Project Structure](/docs/project-structure).

## Feature Modules

The application is broken down into domain-driven features. Each feature is self-contained under `src/`.

| Feature | Responsibility |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`users`** | Authentication, registration, and user profiles. |
| **`profiles`** | Following and unfollowing other users. |
| **`articles`** | Article CRUD, filtering, and tagging support. |
| **`comments`** | Adding and deleting comments on articles. |
| **`tags`** | Managing and listing unique tags. |

## The "Anatomy" of a Feature

Let's look at the `articles` feature as an example:

```bash
src/articles/
├── articles.controller.ts  # Elysia routes and input validation
├── articles.service.ts     # Business logic (slug generation, favoriting)
├── articles.repository.ts  # Raw Drizzle queries
├── articles.mapper.ts      # Transforming DB rows to RealWorld JSON
├── schema/
│   └── articles.schema.ts  # Table and relation definitions
└── dto/                    # ArkType schemas for validation
```

### Dependency Flow
A key rule in this codebase is the **unidirectional dependency flow**:
`Controller` → `Service` → `Repository` → `Database`

Services never touch the `db` object directly; they always go through a Repository. This makes the logic easy to test and ensures a clean separation of concerns.

## Shared Infrastructure

Items that are not feature-specific live in `src/shared`:

- **`shared/errors`**: Custom error classes like `RealWorldError` that handle the specific format required by the spec.
- **`shared/constants`**: Global strings and configuration.
- **`shared/utils`**: Helpers for tasks like slugification.

## Database Management

The `drizzle/` folder in the root contains database migration files generated by `drizzle-kit`. We use relational queries where it makes sense, but fall back to SQL-like queries for complex filtering logic in the repository layer.
