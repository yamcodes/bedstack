title: Project Structure
description: Exploring the structure of the Conduit implementation.
---

The Conduit application is located in `apps/conduit` and serves as a blueprint for the [Bedstack Project Structure](/docs/project-structure).

## Feature Modules

The application is broken down into domain-driven features. Each feature is self-contained under `src/`.

| Feature | Responsibility |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`users`** | Authentication, registration, and user profiles. |
| **`profiles`** | Following and unfollowing other users. |
| **`articles`** | Article CRUD, filtering, and tagging support. |
| **`comments`** | Adding and deleting comments on articles. |
| **`tags`** | Managing and listing unique tags. |

## The "Anatomy" of a Feature

Let's look at the `articles` feature as an example:

<Files>
  <Folder name="src/articles" defaultOpen>
    <File name="articles.controller.ts" description="Elysia routes and input validation" />
    <File name="articles.service.ts" description="Business logic (slug generation, favoriting)" />
    <File name="articles.repository.ts" description="Raw Drizzle queries" />
    <File name="articles.mapper.ts" description="Transforming DB rows to RealWorld JSON" />
    <Folder name="schema">
      <File name="articles.schema.ts" description="Table and relation definitions" />
    </Folder>
    <Folder name="dto" description="ArkType schemas for validation" />
  </Folder>
</Files>

### Dependency Flow
A key rule in this codebase is the **unidirectional dependency flow**:
`Controller` → `Service` → `Repository` → `Database`

Services never touch the `db` object directly; they always go through a Repository. This makes the logic easy to test and ensures a clean separation of concerns.

## Shared Infrastructure

Items that are not feature-specific live in `src/shared`:

<Files>
  <Folder name="src/shared" defaultOpen>
    <Folder name="errors" description="Custom error classes (e.g., RealWorldError)" />
    <Folder name="constants" description="Global strings and configuration" />
    <Folder name="utils" description="Helpers for tasks like slugification" />
  </Folder>
</Files>

## Database Management

The `drizzle/` folder in the root contains database migration files generated by `drizzle-kit`. We use relational queries where it makes sense, but fall back to SQL-like queries for complex filtering logic in the repository layer.
