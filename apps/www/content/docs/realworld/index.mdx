title: RealWorld Example
description: Bedstack's reference implementation of the RealWorld specification.
---

**Conduit** is the flagship example of the [Bedstack Architecture](/docs/(architecture)). It is a production-ready implementation of the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) specification—a "Medium.com" clone.

## What is RealWorld?

The RealWorld project provides a clear specification for building a full-featured blog platform. While "Todo" apps are great for a quick glance, RealWorld conveys the perspective required to build **real** applications.

By adhering to a common [API specification](https://realworld-docs.netlify.app/specifications/backend/introduction), any RealWorld backend (like Bedstack) can be swapped out and used with any RealWorld-compatible frontend (React, Vue, Angular, etc.).

## Why this implementation?

We built Conduit to showcase how Bedstack stays "out of your way" while providing:

- **100% Spec Compliance**: Every endpoint and error response matches the spec perfectly.
- **Architectural Clarity**: Demonstrates the modular Layered Architecture (Controller-Service-Repository).
- **Extreme Performance**: Powered by Bun and Elysia, it outperforms most other RealWorld implementations.
- **Developer Experience**: Instant feedback, co-located tests, and seamless typesafety.

## Getting Started
