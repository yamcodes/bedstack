title: What is Bedstack?
description: A bleeding-edge architecture for high-performance TypeScript backends.
---

Bedstack is a bleeding-edge tech stack and architectural pattern for building backend applications with TypeScript. Its name is an acronym for [**B**un](https://bun.com/) + [**E**lysiaJS](https://elysiajs.com/) + [**D**rizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team/).

## Beyond the Acronym

While the name highlights the core tools, Bedstack is primarily a **philosophy and architecture** for backend development. It is designed to guide developers into the "pit of success" by making the right decisions the easiest ones to make.

### Core Philosophy

1.  **Typesafety by Default**: Types are not a separate layer; they flow through the entire system—from the database schema to the API response.
2.  **Performance First**: By leveraging the Bun runtime and lightweight libraries like Elysia and Drizzle, Bedstack apps are optimized for low latency and high throughput.
3.  **Modular & Layered**: A strict separation between Controllers, Services, and Repositories ensures that your application remains maintainable as it grows.
4.  **Minimal Friction**: Bedstack aims for zero-boilerplate. We favor concise, expressive code over verbose configuration.

## The Tech Stack

The selected technologies share Bedstack's core philosophy:

- **[Bun](https://bun.com/)** - The foundation. A fast, all-in-one JavaScript runtime, package manager, and test runner.
- **[ElysiaJS](https://elysiajs.com/)** - The interface. A performance-first web framework with end-to-end typesafety.
- **[Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/)** - The persistence. A lightweight, headless ORM that feels like writing SQL.
- **[ArkType](https://arktype.io/)** - The validator. A high-performance validation library that matches TypeScript's type system 1:1.
- **[ArkEnv](https://arktype.io/docs/arkenv)** - The configuration. Typesafe environment variable validation built on ArkType.

## Why use Bedstack?

Bedstack is unapologetically opinionated. A tech stack is not just a menu of options; it is a curated path. We've selected these tools because they reinforce each other to create a developer experience that is both fast and safe.

Whether you are building a small MVP or a large-scale production system, the **Bedstack Architecture** provides the structure you need to move fast without breaking things.

## FAQ

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="Can I use Bedstack with Node.js?">
    Bedstack is designed specifically for **Bun**. While most of the tools (Elysia, Drizzle, ArkType) work on Node.js, the core philosophy of Bedstack—unmatched speed and zero-boilerplate—is best achieved using the Bun runtime.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How does it compare to NestJS?">
    Bedstack is heavily inspired by NestJS's modular and layered architecture but aims for **minimal friction**. We avoid heavy use of decorators and complex dependency injection, favoring clean TypeScript patterns and the performance of the Bun ecosystem.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Is it production ready?">
    Yes! Our [RealWorld example implementation](/docs/realworld) is a non-trivial, production-scale application that demonstrates how Bedstack handles real-world complexity, authentication, and database relationships.
