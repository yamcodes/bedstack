description: How to start building with the Bedstack architecture.

To begin building with the Bedstack architecture, you don't "install" Bedstack itself. Instead, you adopt its patterns and use its recommended toolkit.

## Tooling Prerequisites

To build a high-performance Bedstack application, we recommend the following toolchain:

- **[Bun](https://bun.sh)**: The foundation. You'll need Bun installed as your runtime, package manager, and test runner.
- **[ElysiaJS](https://elysiajs.com)**: The web framework.
- **[Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team)**: For typesafe database access.
- **[ArkType](https://arktype.io)**: For runtime validation.

## Your First Bedstack App

Starting a new Bedstack project is straightforward. Follow these steps to initialize your project and adopt the Bedstack pattern:

<Steps>
<Step>
### Initialize your project

Create a new directory and initialize it with Bun.

```bash terminal
mkdir my-bedstack-app
cd my-bedstack-app
bun init
```
</Step>

<Step>
### Add core dependencies

Install the foundational Bedstack tools.

```bash terminal
bun add elysia drizzle-orm arktype
```
</Step>

<Step>
### Adopting the Bedstack Pattern

Once your tools are in place, organize your code into the modular, layered structure:

1.  **Features**: Group your code by domain (e.g., `users`, `products`).
2.  **Layers**: Within each feature, separate logic into **Controllers**, **Services**, and **Repositories**.
3.  **Types**: Ensure types flow from database schema to API responses.
</Step>
</Steps>
