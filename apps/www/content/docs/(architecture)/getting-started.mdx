description: How to start building with the Bedstack architecture.

To begin building with the Bedstack architecture, you don't "install" Bedstack itself. Instead, you adopt its patterns and use its recommended toolkit.

## Tooling Prerequisites

To build a high-performance Bedstack application, we recommend the following toolchain:

- **[Bun](https://bun.sh)**: The foundation. You'll need Bun installed as your runtime, package manager, and test runner.
- **[ElysiaJS](https://elysiajs.com)**: The web framework.
- **[Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team)**: For typesafe database access.
- **[ArkType](https://arktype.io)**: For runtime validation.

## Your First Bedstack App

Starting a new Bedstack project is as simple as initializing a Bun project and adding the core dependencies.

```bash terminal
mkdir my-bedstack-app
cd my-bedstack-app
bun init
bun add elysia drizzle-orm arktype
```

## Adopting the Pattern

Once your tools are in place, the "Bedstack way" involves organizing your code into a **modular, layered structure**:

1.  **Features**: Group your code by domain (e.g., `users`, `products`) rather than file type.
2.  **Layers**: Within each feature, separate your logic into **Controllers**, **Services**, and **Repositories**.
3.  **Types**: Ensure your types flow from your database schema all the way to your API responses.
