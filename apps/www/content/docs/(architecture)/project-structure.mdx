description: How Bedstack organizes code for scalability.
---

Bedstack follows a **Feature-Based** folder structure. Instead of grouping files by their technical type (e.g., putting all controllers in one folder), we group them by the domain feature they belong to.

## Monorepo Layout

Bedstack is designed as a monorepo using **Bun Workspaces** and **Turborepo**.

```bash
.
├── apps
│   ├── api         # Your backend application
│   └── www         # Your documentation or frontend site
├── packages        # Internal packages (shared logic, UI, etc.)
├── bin             # Global scripts and CLI tools
└── turbo.json      # Turborepo configuration
```

## Feature Folders

Inside a Bedstack application (like `apps/api`), code is organized into self-contained feature modules. This makes the codebase easier to navigate and allows features to be moved or scaled independently.

### A Typical Feature Structure

```bash
src/users
├── users.controller.ts   # REST endpoints
├── users.service.ts      # Business logic
├── users.repository.ts    # Database access
├── users.mapper.ts        # Data transformation
├── schema/
│   └── users.schema.ts    # Drizzle table definitions
├── dto/
│   ├── create-user.dto.ts # Input validation (ArkType)
│   └── user.dto.ts        # Output shape
└── interfaces/
    ├── user.interface.ts  # Domain model
    └── user-row.ts        # Database row type
```

## The `shared` Folder

Global utilities, shared middleware, and cross-cutting concerns live in the `src/shared` directory.

- **`shared/constants`**: Global constants (auth, validation, etc.).
- **`shared/errors`**: Global error types and factories.
- **`shared/utils`**: Pure utility functions used app-wide.

> **Tip**: Avoid dumping everything into `shared`. If a utility or constant is only used in one feature, keep it inside that feature's folder.

## Entry Points

- **`src/main.ts`**: The entry point of the application.
- **`src/app.module.ts`**: The "orchestrator" file that composes all individual feature controllers into a single Elysia instance. This pattern is inspired by NestJS to maintain a clean root application file.
